# Simple Racer with AI made in Unreal Engine 5

A demo project showcasing simplistic vehicle movement and PID-controlled vehicle AI. 

All code was written by myself. Assets were taken from marketplace.

## Checkpoint Racing

- In the race game mode the player has to drive through the checkpoints as fast as possible.
- Once a full lap is completed the time will be saved and stored on the game instance.
- Try to beat you own local highscore! :)

## AI with PID Control

- PID control works by injecting inputs to minimize the error between actual and desired state. This enables the AI to follow the spline.
- Two PID controllers are used to control steering and speed respectively.
- Once splines are placed on the map, the AI will find and use them.
